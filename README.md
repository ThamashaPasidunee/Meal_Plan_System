# Gym Net - Meal Plan Sharing System

Gym Net is a social media platform dedicated to fitness enthusiasts. As part of this platform, I developed a Meal Plan Sharing system that allows users to create, manage, and share meal plans with the community. This feature, built using Spring Boot for the REST API and React for the client application, enables users to share their dietary routines and inspire others.

## Features

## Add Meal Plans

Users can create meal plans by providing the following details:

- Picture: Upload an image of the meal plan.
- Title: Give the meal plan a catchy and descriptive title.
- Description: Provide a detailed description of the meal plan.
- Ingredients: List all ingredients required for the meal plan.
- Nutrition: Share the nutritional information, such as calories, proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.
- Dietary Preference: Specify dietary preferences (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free).
  
## Manage Meal Plans

Users can manage their meal plans with the following functionalities:

**Edit**: Modify the details of an existing meal plan.
**Delete**: Remove a meal plan from the list.
**Share**: Share the meal plan with other users on the platform.

## Technology Stack

**Spring Boot**: Used for implementing the REST API, ensuring a robust and scalable backend service.
**React**: Utilized for developing the client application, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface.

Gym Net's Meal Plan Sharing system fosters a community where users can exchange healthy meal ideas and support each other's fitness journeys.
